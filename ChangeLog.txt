2.0 Beta 3:-
This is the latest beta I've made it. It have been tested ,less bugs and flexible. 
IMPORTANT
    - Installing the latest version of Mono is strongly required for Linux and MacOSX users 
    - Do not press Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Z to interupt the application before launch and before exit due to database data loss,
    I tried to make backup process before launch and after launch because the library for SQLite is not accurately designed for
        program failers.  
FEATURES
    - Code have been organized in different classes in order to make project more flexible
	- GUI Windows are now supporting all command line features and settings and easier to use
	- You can customize release.zip file name in which you like
	- All your release zip files are now collected in one directory called Output to easily access to them. And old
	release zip files are collected in Old directory with date time
	- Enhanced command line arguments for Windows users. 
	- Your settings and database of your project is saved in your AppData directory in roaming  called setting.db 
	Windows => C:\Users\<Your name>\AppData\Roaming\Packager> , in Linux => /home/<Your username>/.packager
	- Logging is no longer supported due to many bugs in Common.Logging :-( in Windows and Linux
	- Including TabStrip and FastColoredTextBox assemblies into this project for development
	- Including Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.* for Windows
	- Creating Packager GUI.cmd for fast access to the GUI configuration and Packager help.cmd for showing help instead of typing > packager.exe -h many times
	- Organizing Project code
    - Inserting standard headers for all application code files
    - Create new logging table for logging
    - Reformat many codes in order to make it beautiful
	- All database will backup before launching the application and after launching the application in order to prevent data loss. Right now 
		50-70% is chance of restoring data without loss them. These feature slow down the application startup and shutdown about 50% more
	- Create  Logging and Configuration tables into the database. Configuration is 35% ready to use for program configuration only, logging
		for feature and will be integrated to the GUI
    - GUI is now supported for Linux using mono or dnx, but it is slow and less dynamic than Windows. But at least work
    - Tested and run well on dnx based on dnvm project that made by Microsoft for Multiple platform support for .NET freamwork
    - Output is colored to beutify it 
    - Added Tools.ConsoleColor to integrate colorful output
